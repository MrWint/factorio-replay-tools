reach distance
  - distance between player position and entity collision box
  - also true for resource nodes (collision box only -0.1 - 0.1 -> shorter apparent reach)
  - default distances
    - resource reach: 2.7

player speed: 0.15 tiles/tick -> 38/256 ortho, 27/256 diagonal

player movement:
- Character::calculateNewPositionInternal
  - calc new position
  - If no collisions, full movement
  - If ortho, try slide over corner and move if successful
  - else (diagonal): check horizontal, then vertical component separately and move if no collision
  - If not moved yet, check if length of movement vector is > 0.1 (x^2+y^2 > 0.01), then repeat with half movement, else return No Movement (moves on to short movement)
- Character::calculateShortMovement
  - if diagonal movement, No Movement
  - start with 8 units, move and return if no collision, decrement otherwise, No Movement if reaches 0

hand crafting / manual mining:
- progress is kept in double and incremented each tick, crafting/mining done when it reached crafting/mining time amount, then resets to 0
- due to rounding errors some crafts might/mining take an additional tick (e.g 31 ticks instead of 30)

Burner Miner
- progress is added each tick proportional to mining speed and energy consumed. Once it reaches mining time, mining time is subtracted but leftover is kept
- first mining operation takes 241 ticks due to rounding errors, all remaining ones 240
  - technically the rounding errors keep accumulating, and after ~2 trillion iterations it will cause another 241 tick cycle
